I learned that Git is a powerful version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with others efficiently. It helps developers manage different versions of a project, revert to previous states, and work on multiple features simultaneously using branches. Git also allows easy collaboration through platforms like GitHub, where code can be shared, reviewed, and improved by teams.
